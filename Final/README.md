## Introduction
This project involves a thorough analysis of a dataset from a streaming platform. The dataset contains various attributes of titles such as type, genre, ratings, and release years. The goal is to uncover patterns and structures within this multi-dimensional dataset using machine learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises 8,804 titles with features like type, listed_in (genre), rating, and release_year. It is notable for its categorial diversity and the richness of the content attributes.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset file `netflix_titles.csv`.
- `scripts/`: Contains all the Python scripts used for analysis, including data cleaning, clustering, and PCA.
- `images/`: Stores visualizations generated from the scripts, such as cluster plots and PCA scatter plots.
- `report/`: Contains the final project report in a Quarto format file.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Requirements
List of libraries and tools required to run the scripts, for example:
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or similar (for .ipynb files)
