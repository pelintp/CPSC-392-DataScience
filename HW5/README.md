# Digit Recognition Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) from images. We use the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems.

## Models Used
1. **Logistic Regression**: A baseline model for comparison, implemented using `scikit-learn`.
2. **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A more complex model built using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`, designed to capture more intricate patterns in the image data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- matplotlib (for plotting results)

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure all required packages are installed.
3. Run the script for either logistic regression or the deep neural network.
